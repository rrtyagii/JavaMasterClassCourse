/* Encapsulation is the mechanism that allows you to restrict access to certain components in
*  the objects that you are creating. So, you're able to protect the members of a class from
*  external access, in order to really guard against unauthorized access.  
*  
*  Now we are not talking security here. But we're stopping outsiders, in other words classes
*  or code outside of the class that you're working on, from accessing the inner workings of a
*  class.
*  
*  So, it can be very useful to hide that inner working from another class to ,sort of, give 
*  you more control and to be able to enable you to change things without breaking code 
*  elsewhere.
